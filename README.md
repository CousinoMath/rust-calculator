This project is a CLI calculator written in Rust, which is my standard task to
learn a programming language.

## The Calculator ##

The calculator supports all four arithmetic operations, exponentiation via `^`,
exponential and logarithmic functions, trignometric functions,
constants&mdash;`pi` and `e`, and assigning numbers to variables. A blank input
ends the REPL. 

## TODO ##

* Doc Comments `///` and `/** */` and `//!` for module comments
